# DNS over HTTPS iOS Profiles

One of the new features in iOS 14 is [the ability to encrypt DNS](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10047/) without needing a VPN app. The profiles in this repo use this new ability to enable DNS over HTTPS for the entire system. This increases your security and privacy.

## Compare

All profiles use DNS over HTTPS and support both IPv4 and IPv6.

## Install on iOS and iPadOS 14 or higher

1. Using Safari, choose the desired profile above.

3. You'll be asked if you want to allow the profile download. Tap **Allow**.
4. You'll see a *Profile Downloaded* alert. Tap **Close**.
5. Open the *Settings* app. There will be a *Profile Downloaded* section near the top. Open that.
6. Inside, it will show the profile name and info. Tap **Install**.
7. Enter your passcode.
8. You'll see a warning that the profile might monitor your network traffic, and that it's unsigned. Tap **Install**.

## Install on macOS 11 or higher

1. Using Safari, choose the desired profile above.
2. Right-click the **Raw** button and choose *Download Linked File*.
3. Locate the downloaded file and remove the *.txt* file extension (so it ends in *.mobileconfig* only).
4. Double-click the file, you'll see an alert telling you what to do next. Close that.
5. Open the *Settings* app. There will be a new *Profiles* section. Open that.
6. Inside, it will show the profile name and info. Click **Install**.

8. You'll see a warning that the profile is unsigned. Click **Install**.
9. The profile will be installed.

If you're scared of the warning in Step 8, I'd suggest just using a VPN app instead, such as [Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 app](https://1.1.1.1/) or one [suggested by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-vpn-service/).
